## What is JixiPix Pastello 1.1.7 Win Mac?
  
JixiPix Pastello 1.1.7 Win Mac is a software and plugin that takes you back to the 15th century, away from brushes and large strokes and into the realm of dry media with color that is both brilliant and subtle[^1^]. The "Dry color method" made famous by Leonardo da Vinci is so powerful in its simplicity and beauty with its black and red chalk and yellow pastel highlights[^1^]. Later, artists would paint charming portraits in a smooth heavily blended fashion. Move forward a few centuries later and pastel quickly became filled with brilliant color and crisp detail[^1^]. Fast forward to today and a digital age has made it so you, the artist, can mix and match media that is difficult or impossible in a traditional setting[^1^].
  
JixiPix Pastello 1.1.7 Win Mac makes it simple and convenient. Simply place an image in the app and watch as it turns into a Pastel, Chalk, Charcoal, Crayon, Colored Pencil and Graphite drawing[^1^]. Choose to use each one of the medias by themselves, or combining them using layers for an interesting expressive sketch full of colorful personality and passion[^1^]. The best part is Pastello does all the work for you.
